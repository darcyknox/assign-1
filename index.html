    <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
    <p>We believe in positive respectful partnerships between children, families, caregivers and teachers where we value our community's diversity. We aim to support children's learning through a stimulating prepared environment that nurtures and
      develops dispositions for learning and provides opportunities for success, challenges, individual interests, and freedom of choice. Our community fosters contextual, collaborative and reciprocal learning, where teachers are facilitators, carers
      and friends of the children. We empower children to be independent, competent, confident, compassionate and responsible human beings, and most importantly to have fun in the process.</p>
